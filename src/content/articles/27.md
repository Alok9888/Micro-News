**_Largest bonus issue in Indian equity markets_**

On September 5, 2024, the **Board of Directors** of **Reliance Industries Limited (RIL)** approved the issue of bonus shares in the **ratio of 1:1.**

Accordingly, every shareholder holding one fully paid-up equity share of Rs 10 each on the record date received one fully paid-up equity share of Rs 10 each.

The record date for determining shareholders eligible for the issue of 1:1 bonus shares was **October 28, 2024.**

This was the **largest ever issuance of bonus equity shares** in the Indian equity market.

This is the **sixth bonus issue** from RIL since its Initial Public Offering (IPO) and the second in this Golden Decade.

The bonus issue is a testimony to Reliance’s continued commitment towards rewarding shareholders during the Golden Decade from 2017 to 2027:

- In 2017, Reliance had issued bonus shares in the ratio of 1:1
- This was followed by a Rights Issue in 2020, where the shareholder’s investment has grown 2.5 times already.
- In July 2023, Jio Financial Services Limited was demerged, which is valued 35% higher today from its listing.

Reliance remains committed to its mission of creating all-round value for all its stakeholders in the true spirit of its **‘We Care’ philosophy**.
