Nine hundred children celebrated a unique Olympic Day, organised by Reliance Foundation, featuring a special carnival as part of the International Olympic Committee (IOC)’s _Let’s Move India_ initiative, promoting volunteerism and sports.

The event, held on June 22, 2024, at Reliance Corporate Park (RCP) in Mumbai, treated children from disadvantaged communities across Mumbai to a day filled with fun, sports, and educational activities centred around Olympic values such as excellence, respect, and friendship.

The highlight of the event was a meet-and-greet session with six-time Olympian Shiva Keshavan. He shared his experiences and emphasised the importance of key Olympic values such as excellence, respect, and friendship with the children.

More than 200 employees from the Reliance ecosystem across verticals volunteered for the initiative, overseeing various sports stations such as basketball, football shootouts, walking races, and fitness sessions, alongside drawing and art activities.

Through the _Let’s Move India_ campaign, Reliance Foundation aimed to promote inclusivity, development, and the importance of physical activity among 10,000 children from disadvantaged communities across multiple cities in India in the coming weeks.
