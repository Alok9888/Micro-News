In an **industry-first initiative**, Jio-bp recruited women in the **aviation business for both refuelling aircraft and driving the refueller,** resonating with its core values of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI).

Bobby Kumari and Robina **Chakrabarty joined team Jio-bp as aviation field executives (AFEs) earlier this year.**

​**Kumari**, who is a sports enthusiast and has **won many medals in kabaddi and air rifle and air pistol shooting** and was a part of the **National Cadet Corps**, expressed her excitement in joining Jio-bp as an AFE, sharing, “I have always loved challenges, hence my inclination towards sports. Jio-bp gave me the opportunity to take up a job role which is a first in the aviation industry. It fills me pride and a sense of responsibility to pave the path for many more women like me."​

**​​Chakrabarty,** who is a **travel vlogger** by passion, expressed how blessed she felt about the opportunity to be part of Jio-bp: “This opportunity is like a stepping stone towards building ‘me’. When everyone around doubted my capability, I took up a job which was unique and challenging. I appreciate how the organisation embraced me and ensured a safe and respectful workspace. I believe this is the beginning of aiming for the higher sky.”

Finding the fitment for this unique job role had many challenges, including finding women with the **required educational background, heavy vehicle driving license, readiness to relocate**, and most importantly, the intent to take up a job role that was perceived to be largely male dominated.
