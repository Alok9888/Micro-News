### Stepping into the new intelligence age

**Jensen Huang:** This morning we've been talking about AI. And the last time you and I spent time together, we were talking about AI, and the time before that, we were talking about AI. And now you could see we don't really have much to talk about aside from AI. No one has contributed more, Mukesh, to help India become a high-tech and a deep-tech India. Now you're at the beginning of that journey. You have great aspirations. I know you have deep aspirations to help India become a deep-tech industry. What gives you that conviction? And why is artificial intelligence that moment for India?

**Mukesh Ambani:** While I was listening to you, you talked about NVIDIA being an exotic place. I was thinking that when you were in India, I have got to give you my version of what NVIDIA means to me. There is a very important word link which is called _Vidya_. In Hindi, _Vidya_ means knowledge.

**Jensen Huang:** I knew it! I named the company, right? So, everybody said, "NVIDIA, what a horrible name. You will never make it." But I knew what it meant, and I stuck with it.

**Mukesh Ambani:** You can take credit for this interpretation, no problem. If we think about _Vidya_, it is Saraswati, and Saraswati is our goddess of knowledge. When you devote yourself sincerely to the goddess of knowledge and acquire it, then in our tradition, the goddess of prosperity, which is Lakshmi, follows.

What you are driving is the knowledge revolution, converting into what I call the intelligence revolution. And that drives prosperity across the world for all the 8 billion people. I think we are at the doorsteps of **the new intelligence age**. On behalf of everybody, I am very proud to have you as my friend, welcome to India, and thank you for contributing to bringing the intelligence age in our lifetime.

### Building India into a premier digital society

**Mukesh Ambani:** Our Prime Minister has said this is a new aspirational India. We are among the only countries in the world where the average age of 1.4 billion Indians is below 35. What is driving our economy is not only new technology like AI but also aspirations.

The Prime Minister’s leadership in converting India into a premier digital society has been vital and continues to drive activity at the ground level. It's demography, leadership, and raw talent that are driving this transformation.

India is fast becoming an innovation hub for the world. Today, apart from the US and China, India has one of the best digital connectivity infrastructures—4G, 5G, and broadband. Jio took India from No. 158 in the world to No. 1 in eight years. Today, Jio is the largest data company in the world, delivering about 16 Exabytes of data this year.

What’s most satisfying is that Jio delivers data at $0.15 per GB, compared to $3.5 per GB globally. This is the gift of technology to the people of India, and it brings equality to the world.

**Jensen Huang:** Do you encourage your customers to use their phones?

**Mukesh Ambani:** We do. This perpetual value that technology has delivered amounts to $500-$700 billion a year, year on year, for Indians.

### Reliance and Nvidia partner to build AI infrastructure in India

Huang announced that NVIDIA has entered a partnership with Reliance to build AI infrastructure in India:  
“In order to lead in artificial intelligence, you need to have AI model technology, massive quantities of data, and AI infrastructure. **And we're announcing that Reliance and Nvidia are partnering to build AI infrastructure here in India.**

India has a large population of users, which creates the flywheel effect needed for AI to thrive globally.”
