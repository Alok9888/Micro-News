​​Distinguished guests, ​ladies and gentlemen,

_Namaskar._

Good evening.

Thank you Piyush *bhai*, Rahul, Shereen, and the esteemed jury for this incredible honour. ​Congratulations to CNBC-TV18 for completing 25 glorious years of setting the gold standard in business journalism and being the voice of credibility, leadership and inspiration for a new India.

I am deeply honoured to receive this award and I accept it with utmost humility and gratitude. This recognition is not just a personal honour. It is a tribute to our country, India. India is where it all began. We are the cradle of civilisation. A land of timeless values and enduring wisdom. And today, ​India is also where the future is being shared, with the world's youngest population and the fastest growing economy.

In many ways, this is a defining moment in India's journey. I believe our time​ has come.

I grew up in a family where Indianness was a way of life. My maternal grandmother was a Gandhian and a freedom fighter. From a very young age, like all Indians growing up, we were taught the values of loving your country, serving its people and protecting its ideals. And then, I got married into a family that shared the same deep sense of pride in India.

I've always believed that the essence of India's growth story lies in the pursuit of excellence and innovation. These ideals are embedded in our DNA, whether it is in our ancient texts, our scientific achievements and the entrepreneurial spirit of every Indian. As a nation, we are a living proof that ordinary people can dream extraordinary dreams and work tirelessly to make them come true.

Mukesh and I have been fortunate to witness and be a part of this journey. Reliance, which started as a small textile company, has grown to become one of the top global companies, fuelled by a relentess commitment to innovation and a passion for excellence. My own journey has been guided by these values.

As a young Bharatanatyam dancer, I dreamed of creating a space where India's artistic brilliance shines on the global stage. That dream became the Nita Mukesh Ambani Cultural Centre.

I am proud to share that **we have so far hosted more than 6,000 artists and over two million guests at NMACC**. Not only from India but around the world.

In less than two years, **NMACC has been named one of the top seven cultural spaces in the world—a must visit, by an international publication**.

Similarly, I began my journey as a teacher. My work in education started with a simple belief that every child in India deserves access to world-class opportunities.

**Today, we run 16 schools across the country and our endeavour is to raise the global leaders of tomorrow.**

Just yesterday, our **Dhirubhai Ambani International School was ranked 11<sup>th</sup> among the top IB schools in the world**, proving that our children and our teachers are nothing less the best globally.

Earlier this year, for the first time in the history of the Olympics, we hosted the first ever India House at the Paris Games 2024. India House because a space where we honoured our athletes, celebrated our stories, and showcased India's beauty, depth, diversity, culture, and heritage to the world. A France television journalist went on to report that if country houses were a category, our India House would win the gold.

I am happy to share Devendra *ji* was with us at the beginning of our Olympic journey dream. And early next year, we will take another bold step by presenting India's bid to host the 2036 Summer Olympic Games in our counry, *Bharat*.

**This is the India I dream of: A nation that leads the world, with its boldness, brilliance, creativity, and culture.** A nation that doesn't just follow but sets the benchmarks for excellence across industries and fields. I firmly believe that this century belongs to India. More importantly, it belongs to us women.

As Piyush *bhai* said, women will not only transform India's growth story with their innovation and leadership.

**Tonight, I dedicate this award to every woman who walks the path of action, devotion, knowledge, motherhood, leadership compassion, and of resi​lience.**

I would also like to dedicate this award to my three wonderful daughters—Isha, Shloka, and Radhika. And my two precious granddaughters, Aadiyashakti and Veda. You remind me every day that the greatest legacy we can leave is a happy, safe, and kind world, where every child, girl or boy, dares to dream without limits, achieves without barriers, and has access to equal opportunities.

Let us all re-dedicate ourselves to building an India that chases excellence, embraces innovation and carries its cultural heritage into a future of infinite possibilities. Together, let us create a *Bharat* that leads the world not just economically but also with its heart, its heritage, and hopefulness.

_Thank you once again._

_Jai Hind._
