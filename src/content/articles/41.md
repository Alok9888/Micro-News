On  **January 24, 2024, the International Day of Education,** leaders from the private sector and civil society came together to launch **LiftEd (Learning and Innovation in FLN to Transform Education),** an initiative poised to impact the lives of four million children in India over the next five years.

Speaking about LiftEd,  **Jagannatha Kumar, CEO, Reliance Foundation,** said, "Providing children a strong start to their learning journey ensures them a bright future where they can fully realise their potential. Reliance Foundation shares this vision with all the consortium partners who have come together to launch LiftEd to foster learning and innovation in foundational literacy and numeracy. Bringing together the consortium's collective strength and experience and aligning with the Government of India's NIPUN Bharat, LiftEd could prove life-changing for millions of children across India."

LiftEd is anchored by founding partners such as Atlassian Foundation, Bridges Outcomes Partnerships, British Asian Trust, the Maitri Trust, Michael & Susan Dell Foundation, Reliance Foundation, Standard Chartered Bank, UBS Optimus Foundation, and USAID.

The British Asian Trust is the programme leader and Central Square Foundation and Dalberg Advisors are serving as design and technical partners. ​

Acknowleding that collaborative efforts from the private sector and civil society can act as an 'impact multiplier' to reinforce the government's commitment to furthering India's education goals, LiftEd brings a vibrant and diverse mix of education experts together to improve FLN in India, raising up to USD 20 million (INR 166 crore). ​

Through LiftEd, the diverse coalition steering the initiative aims to strengthen India's education ecosystem, unleash the potential of young India and improve life prospects for millions.
