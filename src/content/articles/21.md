In February 2024, Reliance and Disney announced a strategic joint venture (JV) that will combine the businesses of Viacom18 and Star India.

As part of this JV, Reliance has invested ₹11,500 crore (~US$ 1.4 billion), while Disney is providing content license.

**Nita M Ambani will be the Chairperson of the JV.**

The JV is ready to lead the transformation of India’s digital streaming eco-system and grow the linear TV space across entertainment and sports.

The JV was completed in November this year.
