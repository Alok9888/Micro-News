On International Women’s Day in March 2024, **Nita M Ambani**, Founder, Her Circle and Founder-Chairperson, Reliance Foundation, reflected on Her Circle’s journey in bridging the digital gender divide, on grassroots programmes, and on major programmes she supports, in a conversation with Her Circle Editor-in-Chief Tanya Chaitanya.

Ambani unveiled the **WinnHER Circle Project** that highlights her passion for sports and gender inclusion.

“The WinnHER Circle Project fosters a culture that empowers women in sports, spotlights the effort of women athletes and tells their stories of excellence.

The intent is to encourage women and girls to believe that the opportunities in the space of sports are unlimited and at par for all genders,” shared Ambani.
