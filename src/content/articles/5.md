The Paris 2024 Olympics saw plenty of historic firsts. Among these was one that held immense significance for India—the first-ever country House at the Olympic Games—**the** **India House**.

Conceptualised by **Reliance Foundation** as part of their partnership with the **Indian Olympic Association (IOA**), **India House** celebrated the nation’s rich cultural and sporting heritage, showcasing India’s storied past, vibrant present, and exciting future alongside advances in technology and digitalisation.

Speaking about the significance of the India House earlier in June, **Nita M Ambani, IOC member and Founder and Chairperson, Reliance Foundation, said,** “It is with immense joy and excitement that I am thrilled to announce the first-ever India House at the Paris Olympic Games. The IOC session in India last year, the first in 40 years, was a key milestone in our Olympic journey. And we are delighted to continue this momentum with the launch of India House – a space where we will honour our athletes, celebrate our wins, share our stories, and welcome the world to India.”

**She further added,** “We truly hope that India House will be one more step towards fulfilling the shared dream of 1.4 billion Indians to bring the Olympic Movement to India!”
