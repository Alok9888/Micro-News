A landmark gathering of public and private practitioners spanning the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) spectrum convened to share insights and experience play-based learning at Reliance Foundation's _Building Flourishing Futures_ conference in April 2024.

Showing deep involvement in the subject at the conference, Isha Ambani, Director, Reliance Industries Limited and Vice Chairperson, Dhirubhai Ambani International School, was in rapt attention through the sessions, keenly engaging with experts and attending demonstrations with practitioners at various learning stations.

The two-day conference was held at the Dhirubhai Ambani International School (DAIS) in Mumbai and explored innovative practices and approaches for developing playful parents, teachers, and communities. It brought together diverse practitioners from the ECCE system, academics and experts from India and internationally.

Contributing towards the goal of universalization of ECCE as articulated in India's National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, speakers and participants had a range of learning and educational experiences.

Through the two days, participants including _anganwadi_ workers, teachers, principals, policy makers and representatives from philanthropies explored a burst of ideas, engaged in animated play-based learning demonstrations, discussed nuances of policies and practice, caregiving and strategies for cross-learning, towards holistic early childhood care, education and development.

Reflecting Reliance Foundation Founder and Chairperson Nita M Ambani's philosophy of 'Happy School, Happy Learners', educators at the Reliance Foundation schools and the Dhirubhai Ambani International School create stimulating learning environments, from the best of Indian and international early childhood learning practices.
